# Lab 6 â€“ Node.js and Pystache
The first step was confirming the installation of Node.js, npm, and Python.  
![lab6#1.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%231.png)  
Confirmed Node.js v22.15.0, npm v10.9.2, and Python 3.13.3 were installed successfully.  
This script creates a basic HTTP server that displays "Hello, World!" in the browser.  
```bash
node hello-world.js
```  
![lab6#2.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%232.png)  
The server started on port 3000.

Navigating to `127.0.0.1:3000` displayed the message "Hello, World!".  
This script also starts a server but logs request/response events to the console.  
```bash
node hello.js
```  
![lab6#4.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%234.png)  
Each time the browser refreshed, it printed log messages to the terminal.

The message "Hello World!" was displayed in the browser on port 8080.  
This server updates and tracks how many times the page has been refreshed.  
```bash
node http.js
```  
![lab6#6.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%236.png)  
The console displayed incrementing values each time the page was refreshed.  
![lab6#7.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%237.png)  
The browser output showed the current number of refreshes. This data was stored in `test.txt`.  
Pystache was installed using pip and used to render Mustache-style templates in Python.  
```bash
pip install pystache
```  
![lab6#8.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%238.png)  
Pystache installed successfully.  
This script demonstrates rendering of direct template strings, template files, and parsed templates.  
```bash
python say_hello.py
```  
![lab6#9.png](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/raw/main/lab6%239.png)  
The output showed multiple template renderings including "Hi Alexa!", "Hello, World!", and parsed lines using data.
